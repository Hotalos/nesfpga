Introductional Reading on the NES

There are different sources of information stemming from the NES Emulating scene. Most information in this thesis come from reading floating .txt files, wiki pages,
forum entries and IRC gossip, which all are usually not considered for citation in an academic context.
This thesis tries to put some of these information in my own words, which aims to simplify things from a electronic engineering perspective, and build a fun project
that can be used to teach Hardware Design. Another goal is to provide a general overview about the NES System, as it has been written by many before.

The appendix contains a few should also considered be part

what it means to gather information from old .txt files, irc channels and forum/wiki consensus.

 â€žWhen was the last time you spent a pleasant evening in a comfortable chair, reading a good program?" - Donald Knuth

Few languages are further away from this literate programming 

meta-programming / vhdl frontend
80s style language, new language design have it hard because of proprietary vendor tools.
the quality of the tools that are provided by the big fpga vendors are abysmal quality. 
open source approach, opening inhibited by patents and intellectual property bullshit thinking
fpga have failed the diy dream of software-solderable hardware. instead, xilinx delievers a world of pain.
allthough the myhdl approach is not comparable in performance to commercial tools, it can radically simplify testing
when working in a modern, elegant script language like python.

MyHDL provides a way to describe a hardware simulation in python.
because the current state of afairs with FPGAs leave no other choice than working in establishment languages like
VHDL or Verilog, because the proprietary synthesizer tools provide nothing else.


it might even be possible to write a netlist backend.
