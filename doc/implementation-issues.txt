- Tristate vs. Multiplexer design
	- Tristate are not implemented in FPGA hardware nowadays, but for compatibility reasons, automatic
		transformation to mux busses are well-supported in synthesizer, allthough not recommended
	- Dan Leach's 6502 core was a tristate design
	- Bad coding leads to undefined simulation states and possible mismatches
	- Multiplexer design in new code
	- Some NES Components have an external discrete address decoder. This makes sense to combine with a muxer design, because the decoding logic lands in one hierarchical block
	- Input registers and APU are placed and decoded inside the CPU chip, but can equally be distinct devices on the memory bus. Only drawback is that the APU needs a connection to the internal CPU clock
	- Muxes imply a different design, because address decoding is moved outside of the device.
